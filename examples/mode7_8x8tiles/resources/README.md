# Notes

The texture file (textures.xcf/textures.gif) were edited in GIMP.
The TinyFPGA.gpl file is an indexed-mode palette that maps to the colours
used by TinyFPGA.

The .h file is a raw export of the texture data from GIMP.
The .h file was massaged to create the .mem file in the example.

The tile map was edited using the excellent "Tiled" program, and then exported
as CSV (and again, massaged a little to get into the .mem format).
